/*
 * U1 L5 — SCANNER INPUT AND PSEUDOCODE · STARTER CODE
 * 7184 Software Development · Unit 1, Lesson 5
 *
 * ALREADY HERE:  Lessons 1–4 finished — the title screen, the formatted status
 *                line, String methods, combat math, the health bar.
 * YOU'RE ADDING: pseudocode first, then a Scanner so the game asks the player
 *                questions instead of hard-coding the answers.
 *
 *     javac Main.java
 *     java Main
 *
 * DESIGN BEFORE YOU TYPE. Part 1 is written English, not Java. Everyone wants
 * to skip it. The people who skip it write the nextLine() bug and then spend
 * twenty minutes not understanding why the program refuses to stop.

         * TODO 1: PSEUDOCODE — the design, in English, before any Java.
         *
         *   Write out what the program will ASK for and what it will DO with
         *   each answer. Use plain words in capitals for the decisions:
         *   ASK, IF, SET, SHOW, REPEAT UNTIL.
         *
         *   Mine looks like this — yours should match YOUR game:
         *
         *       ASK for the player's name
         *       IF the name is blank
         *           USE "Challenger" instead
         *       ASK for difficulty 1-3
         *       SET enemy health based on difficulty
         *       SHOW a summary and wait for Enter
         *
         *   Leave it here as a comment when you're done. It is part of what
         *   you turn in, and in six weeks it is how you'll remember what this
         *   file was supposed to do.
         * 
         * ASK for the player's name
         * IF the name is blank 
         * USE "Fighter" instead
         * ASK for difficulty 1-3
         * SET enemy health based on diffficulty
         * SHOW A summary and wait for enter
         * 
         * ASK for players weapon type (Sword, bow, magic)
         * IF the type is blank(Default to sword)
         * UPDATE damage based on weapon type
