/*
 * U1 L6 — CONDITIONALS: if, else if, else · STARTER CODE
 * 7184 Software Development · Unit 1, Lesson 6
 *
 * ALREADY HERE:  Lessons 1-5 finished — the title screen, the status line,
 *                combat math, the health bar, and a Scanner that asks the
 *                player questions.
 * YOU'RE ADDING: decisions. Until today your program ran the same way every
 *                time. Now it branches.
 *
 *     javac Main.java
 *     java Main
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * COMING FROM PYTHON? THREE DIFFERENCES
 *
 *   parentheses are REQUIRED     if (health > 0)      not  if health > 0
 *   braces, not indentation      { ... }              not  a colon
 *   else if, not elif
 *
 * Indentation means NOTHING to the compiler and EVERYTHING to the next person
 * who reads your code. Keep it tidy anyway.
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * THE NEW IDEA: SHORT-CIRCUIT EVALUATION
 *
 *     if (swings > 0 && hits / swings > 0.5) { ... }
 *
 *   If swings is 0, Java NEVER evaluates the right-hand side, so there is no
 *   divide-by-zero. && stops at the first false; || stops at the first true.
 *
 *   ORDER MATTERS. Flip those two conditions around and the program throws.
 *   Try it once, on purpose, so you have seen it.
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * TODO 1: the attack roll — if / else if / else
 *
 *           int roll = 7;              // hard-coded on purpose; L12 makes it random
 *           int damage2;
 *
 *           if (roll >= 9) {
 *               damage2 = enemyPower * 2;
 *               System.out.println("CRITICAL HIT!");
 *           } else if (roll >= 3) {
 *               damage2 = enemyPower;
 *               System.out.println("A solid hit.");
 *           } else {
 *               damage2 = 0;
 *               System.out.println("You miss.");
 *           }
 *
 *           enemyHealth -= damage2;
 *
 *         THEN DO THIS, AND DO NOT SKIP IT:
 *         Change roll to 10, run. Change it to 5, run. Change it to 1, run.
 *         WALK ALL THREE BRANCHES. It costs two minutes, and it is the first
 *         real testing you will do in this course.
 * 
 * 
 *
 * TODO 2: the fight can now end.
 *
 *           if (enemyHealth <= 0) {
 *               System.out.println("The " + enemyName + " falls!");
 *               alive = true;
 *           } else if (health <= 0) {
 *               System.out.println("You have fallen.");
 *               alive = false;
 *           }
 *
 * TODO 3: compound conditions that mean something.
 *
 *           // The guard comes FIRST. Swap these and a zero divisor throws.
 *           if (swings > 0 && hits / swings > 0.5) {
 *               System.out.println("Your aim is holding up.");
 *           }
 *
 *           if (health < MAX_HEALTH / 4 && gold >= 10) {
 *               System.out.println("You should buy a potion.");
 *           }
 *
 *           if (!alive || enemyHealth <= 0) {
 *               System.out.println("The fight is over.");
 *           }
 *
 * TODO 4: BREAK IT ON PURPOSE — = versus ==
 *
 *         Type this and run it:
 *
 *           if (alive = false) { System.out.println("dead"); }
 *
 *         It COMPILES. It also silently sets alive to false and then does the
 *         wrong thing. One equals sign ASSIGNS; two equals signs COMPARE.
 *
 *         Now try:
 *
 *           if (health = 0) { ... }
 *
 *         That one will NOT compile, because an int is not a boolean. Which is
 *         exactly why this bug only bites you with booleans — the compiler
 *         catches every other case and stays silent on the one that matters.
 *
 *         Put both back the way they were when you are done.
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * TODO 5: close the Lesson 4 TODO at the bottom of this file.
 *
 *         The health bar breaks when health goes above MAX_HEALTH or below 0.
 *         You have been carrying that comment for two lessons. Today you have
 *         the tool:
 *
 *           if (health > MAX_HEALTH) {
 *               health = MAX_HEALTH;
 *           } else if (health < 0) {
 *               health = 0;
 *           }
 *
 *         Test it BOTH ways — drink enough potions to go over, then take
 *         enough damage to go under. The bar has to survive both.
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * FINISHED EARLY?
 *
 *   Write a condition that decides whether the enemy enrages, using at least
 *   two of && || and !. Then say out loud, to your partner, exactly when it
 *   is true. If you cannot say it in one sentence, it is too complicated.
 *
 * BEFORE YOU LEAVE: back up as Arena_U1L6_LastnameF and submit.
